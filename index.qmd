# Well, hi. I'm Trey. :raising_hand_man:  
I'm a father of 2, an [Abundance Democrat](https://www.niskanencenter.org/the-state-capacity-crisis/), and a citizen-scholar based in Honolulu, Hawaii.  
  
At work, I [study and write about](https://uhero.hawaii.edu/category/trey-gordner/) how state and local governments can deliver better results.  

Outside of work, I put good ideas into practice as a member of [boards](https://dbedt.hawaii.gov/hcda/) and [commissions](https://www.honolulucitycouncil.org/charter-commission). And I help good policymakers win elections with the [Oahu Democrats](https://www.oahudemocrats.org/).  

Interested? I want to hear from you: `trey@gogordner.com`
